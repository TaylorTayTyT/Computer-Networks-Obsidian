# Global Internet

At this point, we have seen how to connect a bunch of heterogeneous collection of networks to create an internetwork and to use the simple hierarchy of the IP address somewhat scalable. We now look at techniques that makes routing protocols more scalable.

The above is a general picture of how the Internet may look like. In the modern world, though, the NSFNET backbone is more or less replaced with commercial providers who have built dozens of high-end routers located in major metropolitan areas. 

Notice that each provider and end-user are likely to be an administratively independent entity.  Because of this, there mya be differences in each provider about what best routing protocol to use or what metric is the best. We call each provider's network an *autonomous system* (AS) - a network administered independently of other ASs. 

We look at two scaling issues. The first is routing - we want to minimize the number of network numbers that get carried around in routing protocols and stored in routing tables. The second is address utilization - we don't want the IP address space to get consumed too quickly. 

## Routing Areas

An area is a set of routers configured to exchange link-state information with each other. 
![[Pasted image 20250310111916.png]]
There is one special area, known as backbone area or area 0. A router on the backbone area and a nonbackbone area is a area border router (ABR). 

Routing in a single area is exactly as described before: routers send link-state advertisements to construct a map of the area. However, link-state advertisements do not leave their specific area unless you are a border router. This means that a router does not know the entire topological order of the overall network. 

How does a router determine the next hop for a network in another area? Lets imagine the path of a packet that has to trabe from one nonbackbone are to another. First, it travels from its source network to the backbone area. Then, it crosses the backbone. Finally, it travels from the backbone to the destination network. 

To make this work, the area border routers summarize routing information from one area and make it available in their advertisements to other areas. For example, the information received by R1 can be seen as the costs of reaching the networks in area 1 as if all the routers were directly connected to R1.

In the case where there are two ABRs, routers in that area will have to make a choice of which one they use to various networks, which is easy since those routers will be advertising costs. 

When dividing a domain into areas, the network administrator trades between scalability and optimality of routing. Areas force packets to go to the backbone even if a more optimal path may have been available. It turns out, though, scalability is often more important than optimization. 

Network administrators can use a *virtual link* to decide which routers go in area 0. For example, R1 could share routing information with R8, so R8 is part of the backbone even though it is not directly connected. 

### Interdomain Routing (BGP)

We mentioned that the Internet is organized as a bunch of autonomous systems. 

![[Pasted image 20250310113547.png]]

Autonomous systems allow us to hierarchically aggregating routing information. We divide the routing problem into two parts - routing within an AS and routing between ASs. Since ASs can also be referred to as *domain*, we refer to the two parts of the routing problem as interdomain routing and intradomain routing. 

#### Challenges in Interdomain Routing

Perhaps the most important challenge of interdomain routing today is for each AS to determine its own routing *policies*. For example, a routing policy could look like this:

"Whenever possible, I prefer to send traffic via AS X than via AS Y, but Iâ€™ll use AS Y if it is the only path, and I never want to carry traffic from AS X to AS Y or vice versa."

A key design of interdomain routing is that policies should be supported by the interdomain routing system. In addition, I need to be able to implement such a policy without any help from other ASs, and in the face of other ASs messing up.  Also, there is often a desire to keep the policies *private* for competition reasons. 

There have been two major interdomain routing protocols. The first was the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP), which was bad for scalability. 

The replacement was the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP makes no assumptions about how ASs are interconnected. The model is general enough to accommodate tree-structured internetworks (look at the first image in this document). 

The internet today is fairly complex, so we define a few terms to address that complexity. *Local traffic* is traffic that originates at or terminates on nodes within an AS. *Transit* traffic is traffic that passes through an AS. We classify ASs into three broad types:
- Stub AS - AS with only one connection one one other AS; will only carry local traffic (small corporation)
- Multihomed AS - an AS with connections to more than one other AS, but refuses to carry transit traffic (large corporation)
- Transit AS - AS with connection to more than one other AS and carries both transit and local traffic (backbone provider)
![[Pasted image 20250310114823.png]]
The goals of interdomain routing is rather complex because our optimal path has a couple of requirements. First, it needs to find *some* path that is loop free. Second, paths must compliant with the various policies of the ASs along the path. Hence, we need to find the most optimal non-looping, *policy-compliant* path. 

Interdomain routing is also hard because of scale. The Internet backbone router has to forward any packet anywhere in the Internet. 

Furthermore, the autonomous nature of the domains means that it is impossible to calculate meaningful path costs for a path that crosses multiple AS since each domain has its own scheme for metrics. That means that a cost of 1000 may be acceptable to one AS, but not acceptable to another AS. Hence, interdomain routing advertises only reachability. 
#### Basics of BGP

Each AS has one or more *border routers* thrugh which packets enter and leave the AS. A border router is simply an IP router that is charged with the task of forwarding packets between ASs. 

Each AS that participates in BGP must also have at least one BGP speaker, a router that "speaks" BGP to other BGP speakers in other ASs. 

BGP does not belong to the two main classes of routing protocols: distance-vector nor link-state. Rather, BGP advertises *complete paths* as an eumerated list of ASs to reach a particular network. This is sometimes called a *path-vector* protocol. These complete paths allow for many policy decisions made in accordance with AS and also enables loops to be readily detected. 
![[Pasted image 20250317112050.png]]

We see this an action. Assume that providers are transit networks, while customer networks are stubs A BGP speaker for the AS of provider A would be able to advertise reachability information for each of the network numbers assigned to customers P and Q. 
![[Pasted image 20250317112421.png]]

An important job of the BGP is to prevent the establishment of loops. We look at the figure above. Suppose AS 1 learns that it can reach network 128.96 through AS 2. It advertises this to AS 3, who then advertises back to AS 2. Now, AS 2, for packets addressed to 128.96, might send the packet to AS3, which would then be sent to AS 1, which would then be sent to AS2, causing a loop. The solution to this would be if a router sees itself in a complete path, it knows it should not use that path. 

Clearly, AS numbers need to be unique, and are assigned by a central authority to assure uniqueness. 

An AS will only advertise routes that it considers good enough for itself, meaning it will only advertise the best route according to it s local policies. A BGP speaker, though, is not under any obligation to advertise a route, even if it has one. 

Given that links fail and policies change, BGP speakers need to be able to cancel previous advertised paths. They do this with a negative advertisement known as a *withdrawn route*. Both positive and negative reachability information are carried in a BGP update message. 

![[Pasted image 20250317113229.png]]

Unlike the routing protocols described before, BGP is defined to run on to p of TCP, the reliable transport protocol. Because BGP speaker can rely on TCP, then CGP speakers only need to send an occasional *keepalive* message.

#### Common AS Relationships and Policies

The three common relationships and policies between ASs are:
- *Provider-Customer* - Providers want to connect their customer to the rest of the Internet, so a common policy is to advertise all routes I know to the customer, and advertise all routes I learn from my customer to everyone. 
- *Customer-Provider* - The customer want to get traffic directed to them, and wants to be able to send traffic to the Internet. A common policy would be to advertise my own prefixes and routes learned from my customer to my provider, advertise routers learned from my provider to my customers, but don't advertise routes learned from one provider to another. This is to make sure the customer doesn't find themselves in the business of carrying traffic from one provider to another.
- *Peer* - Two providers who see themselves as equals usually peer to get access to each other's customers without having to pay another provider. The policy here is to advertise routes learned from customers to my peer, advertise routes learned from my peer to my customers, but don't advertise routes from my peer to any provider or vice versa. 
![[Pasted image 20250317115553.png]]
We can see that this figure gives us some structure to the Internet. At the bottom are stub networks, or customers of one or more providers. As we move up, we see providers who have other providers as their customers. At the very top are providers with only customers or peers. 


> [!NOTE] Key Takeaway
> How does all this help in building scalable networks? First, the number of ASs is much smaller than the number of networks. Second, a good interdomain route is finding a path to the right border route, of which there are only a few per AS. Hence, we are using hierarchy to subdivide our problem, and increase scalability. The complexity of interdomain routing is the number of ASs, and the intradomain is focused on a singular AS. 

#### Integrating Interdomain and Intradomain Routing

The question of how do all other routers in a domain get interdomain routing information remains. 

Let's start simple. In the case of a sub AS that only connects to other ASs at a single point, the border router is the only choice for all routes outside the AS. Such a router is a *default route*. 

The next step is to have border routers inject specific routes that they have learned from outside the AS. Consider, for example, the border router fo a provider AS that connects to a customer AS. The router could learn the network prefix 192.4.54/24 is located inside the customer AS, either through BGP or because the ifnormation is configured into the border router. It could inject a route to that prefix into the rougin protocol running inside the provider AS. This would be an advertisement of sort, and cause other routers in the provider AS that the border router is the place to send packets destined for that prefix. 

Finally, the backbone networks. Because backbone networks receive so much routing information, it uses *interior BGP* or *iBGP* to navigate through this information. iBGP enables any router in the AS to learn thebest border router to use when sending a packet to any address. At the same time, each router knows how to get to each border router using a conventional intradomain protocol with no injected information.
